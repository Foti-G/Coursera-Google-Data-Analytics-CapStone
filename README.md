Introduction

Hello, my name is Foti I have ventured into data analysis after spending enough time in both the health care and services industries. Since childhood I had a interest in programming and computer technology, which led me to further explore and learn about data analysis and programming languages. Having worked in a science based field, I felt it was time for a change by learning about R, Python, programming, and data analysis. This renewed interest has guided me to pursue a career change at this time in my life.
Overview
The following case study is meant to show my work, thought process, and efforts using Kaggle, R & SQL programming, and LiberOffice spreadsheet program; these aforementioned are the data analysist tools I used. The data used is cited, and open for public use. I will be using six phases for the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working for a fictional bike share company in Chicago Illinois called Cyclistic. The head of the marketing team along with the director would like to grow the company and are seeking to maximize annuals memberships. The goal is to design a marketing strategy to convert casual riders to annual paying members. I am tasked to gather information and present my findings and strategies to help achieve that goal.
Stakeholders / Characters
Cyclistic:

A bike share company started in 2016 and includes over 5800 bikes and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

The director of marketing and my manager, she is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.
